Hello,

All Libraries in this folder (Windows libs) have been build using the compiler:

(i686-posix-dwarf-rev0, Built by MinGW-W64 project) 7.3.0 in C++11 standard

If the compiled binaries does not work on your machine check you compiler version, and make sure they match.

If you would like to use another compiler and run this project on Windows, download SFML 2.2, TGUI 0.7.7 and Cryptopp 7.0.0 sources and build them using the desired compile
