Hello,

If this binary does not work on windows, make sure you got (i686-posix-dwarf-rev0, Built by MinGW-W64 project) 7.3.0
, as this is the version used to cimpile them from source.

If you would like to use another compiler and run this project on Windows, download SFML 2.2 and TGUI 0.7.7 source and build them using the desired compile
